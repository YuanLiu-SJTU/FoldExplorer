# FoldExplorer
FoldExplorer: Fast and Accurate Protein Structure Search with Sequence-Enhanced Graph Embedding

## Preparation
FoldExplorer is implemented with Python3, so a Python3 (>=3.7) interpreter is required.
At first, download the source code of FoldExplorer from Github:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/YuanLiu-SJTU/FoldExplorer.git
```

Then, we recommend you to use a virtual environment, such as Anaconda, to install the dependencies of FoldExplorer:
``` python
conda create -n FoldExplorer python=3.7
```

## Usage
### Generate descriptors for protein structures using FoldExplorer
